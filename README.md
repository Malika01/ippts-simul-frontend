# Front end for IPPTS algorithm simulation

This is the front end for the IPPTS algorithm simulation. It is a web application that allows the user to choose number of tasks and the number of servers. The user then can specify the DAG (Directed acyclic graph for task dependency) and execution time in each servers for every task. The program will then calculate the best possible schedule for the tasks based IPPTS algorithm.
